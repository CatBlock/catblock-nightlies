# CatBlock Nightlies

### WARNING: TOTALLY UNTESTED CODE WITHIN  
#### Proceed at your peril

Now, with that ***massive disclaimer*** out of the way, let's explain.

If you seriously don't care about CatBlock suddenly breaking, or rendering your browser unusable, or even (accidentally) causing a disastrous Blue Screen of Death, kernel panic or whatever, then feel free to install these versions of CatBlock. (Though a lot of that is almost impossible to happen, you can never say never).

These are based off of the latest, bleeding-edge, practically untested versions of CatBlock that developers live with every day, so don't expect too many bugs, especially of the oldest code and features, such as the ad blocking functionality.

Currently, you can only install the versions from here to use it. However, we are working on getting them installable from a source that can auto-update.

Just a reminder though:  
#### These are beta-quality versions of CatBlock. Do not expect everything to work, but it should be okay if you know what you're doing.
